# Mistakes log

Format: what happened → root cause → error type → prevention tier
(gotcha → rule → hook). Escalate anything recurring.

## 2026-07-06/07 session

1. **DuckDB stored box-local timestamps.** tz-aware inserts silently
   converted to machine-local. Root cause: unverified assumption about
   driver semantics. Type: `wrong-assumption`. Prevention: RULE —
   `store._naive_utc()` on every insert + migration test. ESCALATED.
2. **Settlement result leaked to strategies.** Sanitizing branch built a
   cleaned MarketInfo but fell through to `return info`. Root cause:
   missing early return; no test attacked the channel. Type:
   `missing-verification`. Prevention: HOOK-equivalent — adversarial
   peeker test in CI. ESCALATED.
3. **Vacuous PoC backtest (twice, once in prod run).** Rebalance arb run
   on complement-book data where its trigger is impossible by
   construction; sim returned polite zero fills. Root cause: no
   contract between strategy assumptions and data capabilities. Type:
   `wrong-assumption`. Prevention: RULE — capability guard
   (`hyxlab/capabilities.py`, enforced in `Simulator.__init__`): a test
   that cannot fail is an error. Landing it exposed two more instances
   (vacuous determinism self-test; dead rebalance run in
   run_backtest.py). ESCALATED (2026-07-07).
4. **`pgrep -f` self-match.** Monitoring/kill commands matched their own
   cmdline; reported dead sweep as alive; pkill killed its own shell.
   Type: `tooling-footgun`. Prevention: gotcha — quote patterns / match
   binary path.
5. **4h background job with buffered stdout.** No progress visibility;
   masked the fact the sweep had died. Type: `ops-blindness`.
   Prevention: gotcha — always `python -u` + harness-tracked background
   tasks, never nohup chains.
6. **Migration double-shift near-miss.** Per-distinct-value UPDATE loop
   would have re-shifted colliding values; caught in self-review before
   running. Type: `algorithm-bug`. Prevention: gotcha — timestamp
   migrations as single atomic SQL expressions.
7. **Crossed-candle contamination (1.3%).** Fills at phantom quotes in
   weather v1; found by testing a theorem the user challenged. Type:
   `missing-context` (venue data semantics). Prevention: RULE —
   replay-time gate in `candles_as_snapshots`. ESCALATED.
8. **Weather smoke-peek before pre-registration.** 10-day NYC +23% peek
   preceded threshold lock; disclosed in prereg; full sample showed it
   was noise. Type: `process-slip`. Prevention: gotcha — pipeline smoke
   tests on synthetic data only.

## Pattern analysis (Step 5)

`wrong-assumption` cluster (1, 3, and arguably 7): claims about external
system semantics went unverified until they bit. Systemic fix already
adopted: **probe-before-build** (the data_contracts.md live-validation
pass) — keep applying it to every new source/driver. Items 2+3 justified
the capability guard, which landed 2026-07-07 and immediately caught two
further latent instances of item 3's pattern.
